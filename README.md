#MY GAMES LIST

##Website
Heroku: https://stark-retreat-73573.herokuapp.com/

##Purpose
Tracks the status of all the video games that you are playing

##Inspiration
There are indeed a lot of websites out there that provide similar features, however, I still end up using Ms Excel at the end of the day to track my games. Why? Because Excel is simple and very easy on the eyes. That was all I needed and thus this app was created to solve this (personal) problem. I hope those who share a similar opinion find this app helpful.

##Features
* Users are required to create an account in order to view and create their own list.
* Users are also able to edit and delete their individual game entries
* Games are categorized into three categories: Planning to play, Currently playing, and finished playing.
* The list is for personal-use purposes

##Technologies Used
* Ruby on Rails
* Postgresql
* Bootstrap CSS
* [RatyRate Gem](https://github.com/wazery/ratyrate)
* [Devise Gem](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
* [Rails4-autocomplete Gem](https://github.com/peterwillcn/rails4-autocomplete) 
* HTML5/CSS3

##Future Considerations
* Use an external API to store names of all existing games into the database
* Integrate autofill feature so that users don't have to type the whole name of the game
* Integrate an info page for each game.
